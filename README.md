# pokedex-application
Welcome to my Pokedex App!

With this app, I have implemented a search feature linked to the PokeAPI.

Please use the search feature by typing in any Pokemon's name to generate a Pokemon's ID, name, type(s), generation, habitat, abilities, and moves.

I chose to implement those particular details so that users can quickly access important information about any Pokemon they want all the way up to the most recent Pokemon generation.

Here is a link to the API that I used for this project: https://pokeapi.co/

Please note that the PokeAPI, although up-to-date, can be missing information about specific Pokemon from time to time.

I used Python, HTML, CSS, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL to create my website.

This is my first capstone project! I hope you find it fun, useful, and easy to use.
